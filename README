What would the world look like if there was no TIME?

Would it all end up in either painful infinity/eternity or stay locked?
Or would everything have a sharpened shape because we would not have to worry about time while we approach anything? We could simply experience life more full and aware, because there would be nothing trying to get out attention inbetween. Just imagine the world from the point of view of a tree, a stone or even the universe.
