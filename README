What would the world look like if there was no TIME?

Would it all end up in either painful infinity/eternity or stay locked?
Or would everything have a sharpened shape because we would not have to worry about 
time while we approach anything? We could simply experience life more full and
aware, because there would be nothing trying to draw our attention away from what is happening.  
Just imagine the world from the point of view of a tree, a stone or even the universe.

With this I am trying to create an experience which might let the watcher get a
small idea about how life COULD be.
